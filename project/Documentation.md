# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

A: 500 C: 1500 E: 500

## Problem definition

The client is K.M. who is an ESS student from an international school in Japan. He aims to collect data throughout the school year to analyze the room conditions that are best for plant growth on campus. In detail, room conditions include temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Since he plans to conduct his research throughout a year, he requests the system to be durable and feasible in any weather of a year in Karuizawa. He wants to visualize all data as well as the prediction of room conditions. Lastly, he requests the cost to be low because he is still a student and wouldn’t be able to afford an expensive system. 

## Proposed Solution
Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure and a custom data script that processes and analyzes the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequate precision and range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more elaborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and accuracy required in this application the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the Raspberry Pi [^3]. "The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins, allowing you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).  "[^4]. In addition to the low cost of the Raspberry Pi (> 35USD), this device is programmable and expandable[^1]. I considered alternatives such as different versions of the Pi 400 but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.

Considering the budgetary constraints of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python's open-source nature and platform independence contribute to the long-term viability of the system. The use of Python simplifies potential future enhancements or modifications, allowing for seamless scalability without the need for extensive redevelopment [^5][^6]. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a High level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction [^7]. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is the responsibility of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory [^7], this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition a HLL language will allow me and future developers extend the solution or solve issues promptly.

## Moving average for filtering noisy signals from sensors

one problems that I had while solving success criteria #1 was that the sensor are quite noisy
which presented a problem at the moment of creating a model. I thought about using a pre-processing
step to smooth the data before proceeding with visialization and modeling.
(copy the specific code that we use this)

・・・.py
def moving_average(windowSize: int, x:list) -> list:
    x_smoothed = []
    for i in range(0, len(x)-windowSize):
        x_section = x[i:i+windowSize]
        x_average = sum(x_section)/windowSize
        x_smoothed += [x_average]

    return x_smoothed


I decided to create a function to contain the algorithm for a moving average. This allows for code reuse and modelarity. 
The function receives two inputs, the size of the window (windowSize) and continue the description.....
